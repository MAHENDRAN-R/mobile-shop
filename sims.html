    <h2>PROCESS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Take your Aadhaar card to the telecom operator’s store. You can download a copy of your Aadhaar card and print it or take a soft copy via mAadhaar app as well. Some of them might ask for a photocopy or an emailed copy of this card. For the eKYC (online Know Your Consumer) process, you don’t need a hard copy of the Aadhaar card but some telecom operator stores may ask for this, even if it is unnecessary.</li>
<li>
  The store personnel will key in your Aadhaar number and ask you to authenticate your identity via your fingerprints.
</li>
<li>
  Once this is done, you’ll get a new SIM card and it’ll be activated either immediately or within 48 hours, depending on the telecom operator.
</li>
    </ul>
